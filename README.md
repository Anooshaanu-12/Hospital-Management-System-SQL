# 🏥 Hospital Management System (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Hospital Management System is a relational database project developed using MySQL.  
It is designed to manage hospital operations including patients, doctors, appointments, admissions, rooms, and billing.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of:
- Database Design
- Relational Schema
- Primary & Foreign Keys
- SQL Queries
- Indexing
- Views
- Data Integrity Constraints

## 📊 ER Model Concepts Used
- One-to-Many relationships
- Entity Integrity
- Referential Integrity
- Normalized table design

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `schema.sql` → Database structure (CREATE TABLE statements)
- `data.sql` → Sample data (INSERT statements)

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open MySQL
2. Run `schema.sql`
3. Run `data.sql`
4. Use SELECT queries to explore the database

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients;
SELECT * FROM appointment_details;
```
